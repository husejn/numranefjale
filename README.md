# NumraNeFjale
Numra ne Fjale - Shqip. Numbers to Words - Albanian Language

A java project to convert `long` numbers to textual form in albanian language. Works with numbers as big (or small) as `long` can get.

Currently doesn't support decimal numbers, however it would be very easy to implement such feature if you need it.
